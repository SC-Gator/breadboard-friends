breadboard-friends
==================

A collection of cute breakout boards riding solderless breadboards, mostly for analog audio works

Forked from pichenettes' version and identical except:
- Eagle brd and sch files converted to XML (making possible import into KiCad)
- KiCad versions of boards and schematics
- Added Thonkiconn version of eurojacks
